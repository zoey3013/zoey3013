Hi, Iâ€™m Zoila GarcÃ­a, but you can call me Zoey or Tato ðŸ¥”. I'm a designer with a degree in digital communications ðŸ’». I'm learning about the amazing world of software developing, after being interested in it for years. Iâ€™m interested in backend developing in the most part, but right now I'm like a sponge! I'm soaking all the information that comes my way ðŸ§½. I'm also a twitch streamer, and mostly play games in spanish a few nights a week ðŸŽ®. I really enjoy being creative but solving puzzles is my passion, maybe that's why I enjoy programming so much, is like having a 1000 pc jigsaw in front of you. And I love the joy of problem solving ðŸ§©!
